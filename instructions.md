**Multiple Pages**

-  The "Get an invite" call-to-action throughout the site should be an anchor tag, but doesn't link anywhere. If this was a real website, this could link to a sign up or application form.

#### Stories

-  If this were a real site, each item on this page would be clickable and could link off to each of these stories in their own sites. So each item should be wrapped with an anchor tag, but it won't link anywhere on this project.

#### Pricing

-  The "Pick a plan" call-to-actions in the pricing tiers should be anchor tags, but they don't link anywhere. If this was a real website, this could link to a checkout form.
