###### TODO

HTML:

CSS:

Sass partials - more organised (Kevin live stream) - utilities folder | maps broken up

naked HSL colour format - alpha easily changeable

accent bar - repsonsive height to hero content but relative to viewport

Hamburger - creating manually with spans + pseudo els of parent button | translate lines to form a cross on click

Social icons - gradient fill achieved by displaying that version on top of default as pseudo-el (opacity transitioned + switched on hover)

Grid offset design - switching fluid imgs + background-imgs (cover space where padding on text items causes fluid grid rows to expand)

Stories - clickable links as parent (wrapping everything in links + screwing up grid overlapping layout + position relative bug)
